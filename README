The plan is to make this a web photo gallery.

Recommended development environment:
* Java 7
* STS (http://spring.io/tools) or Eclipse

Nice to have:
* Sourcetree or other graphical GIT client (http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

Copy photos-local.properties to your own version and set your properties. Mysql properties only needed in PROD.

Run:

mvn -Dserver -DXmx1024m -DXms512m -Dspring.profiles.active=local clean install tomcat7:run
